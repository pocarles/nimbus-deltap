# Strategic Launch Plan: Nimbus Delta-P (US Market)

**Status:** Pre-Execution / Strategy Phase
**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026
**Region:** United States (Headquarters: Palm Beach Gardens, FL)
**Currency Basis:** 1.17 USD/EUR

## 1. Executive Summary

The Nimbus Delta-P is a high-pressure (120 bar) portable nitrogen adjustment system designed for the premium off-road, motorsport, and industrial markets. Unlike US market leaders (e.g., Power Tank) that ship empty vessels, Nimbus will leverage a Florida-based "Fill & Ship" hub to deliver the **only "Ready-to-Race" pre-filled nitrogen solution** on the market.

This plan outlines a premium pricing strategy (MSRP $849+) that absorbs high logistical costs (Hazmat shipping) while delivering 50%+ margins. It also defines a scalable B2B partner model controlled via a proprietary "Hologram Seal" system to monetize the refill network without complex metering.

## 2. Market Analysis & Positioning

### A. The Competitive Landscape

The US market is currently polarized between low-end manual tools and high-friction professional tools:

**Low End:** Manual Shock Pumps ($30–$70). Limited to ~300 PSI. Too slow/weak for professional use.

**High End:** Power Tank (Shock Boss) at $699. The direct competitor.
- *Weakness:* They ship empty. The customer must find a welding shop to fill it before first use.
- *Nimbus Advantage:* "Unbox & Go." We ship filled cartridges. This convenience commands a premium.

### B. Niche Market Opportunities (B2B)

Beyond the core "Overland/4x4" suspension market, the Delta-P's high pressure (725 PSI output) and portability fit three specific industrial niches:

1. **Aviation Maintenance (GSE):** Servicing landing gear struts on light aircraft (Cirrus, Cessna) on the tarmac without dragging large "K" tanks.
2. **Industrial Automation:** Refilling nitrogen die springs and gas struts in heavy machinery/robotics.
3. **Commercial Door Installers:** Counter-balancing heavy fire doors and overhead gates.

## 3. Operational Logistics: The "Florida Hub" Model

To bypass the impossibility of shipping pressurized gas from France, we utilize a **hybrid logistics model**:

### Step 1: Import (France → Florida)
- Goods ship **EMPTY** (0 Bar) via Air/Sea freight.
- Regulatory Status: Non-Hazardous Class 9 (Standard Freight). No dangerous goods surcharges.

### Step 2: Production (Palm Beach Gardens)
- Inventory is received, inspected, and **filled to 120 bar** using a local booster/N2 supply.
- Units are sealed and packed for US distribution.
- **Labor:** Handled in-house initially.

### Step 3: Distribution (Outbound)
- **DTC (Direct to Consumer):** Shipped via UPS/FedEx Ground Hazmat (Class 2.2 UN1066). Surcharge (~$40-$55) baked into retail price.
- **B2B (Partners):** Shipped EMPTY via standard ground freight. Partners fill on-site using the Nimbus Refill Station.

## 5. Commercial Strategy & Pricing

Position: "Pro-Grade Equipment" — significantly above the $699 competitor anchor.

### SKU 1: Nimbus Delta-P "Trail Kit"
- **Includes:** Head V2, Digital/Analog Gauge, Hose, 1x Filled Cartridge
- **MSRP:** $849.00

### SKU 2: Nimbus Delta-P "Endurance Kit"
- **Includes:** Head V2, Gauge, Hose, 2x Filled Cartridges
- **MSRP:** $1,099.00
- **Wholesale (Partner):** $769.00 (-30%)
- **Strategic Value:** Pushes cart over $1k; ensures customer has a spare for rotation during refills.

### SKU 3: Nimbus "Pro Refill Station" (B2B Only)
- **Includes:** Charging Ramp (V-RPAZOTE160B) + Workshop Stand
- **MSRP:** $1,499.00

## 6. The Partner Network: Control & Monetization

**The Challenge:** Cannot digitally meter how much nitrogen a partner uses to refill client cartridges.

**The Solution:** Do not tax the gas. Tax the "Official Seal."

### The "Hologram Control" System

**The Rule:** A cartridge is only considered "Nimbus Certified" (and under warranty) if the valve cap is sealed with an unbroken, serialized Nimbus Hologram Sticker.

**The Revenue Stream:** Partners must buy "Refill Packs" from us.
- Pack Cost: $250.00 (Contains 50 Stickers)
- Cost per Refill: $5.00 (Paid to Nimbus upfront)

### Partner Economics (The Pitch)

| Line Item | Amount |
|:---|:---|
| Refill Price to Consumer | $30.00 |
| Cost of Sticker | -$5.00 |
| Cost of Gas | -$0.50 |
| **Partner Net Profit** | **$24.50 (81% Margin)** |

**Why it works:**
- **No Cheating:** If they don't buy stickers, they can't sell "Official Refills" that customers trust.
- **Zero Admin:** We don't audit their books. We just ship stickers.

## 7. Open Questions & Validation Needed

### Logistics
- [ ] Hazmat shipping account setup (UPS/FedEx) — not yet initiated
- [ ] Source "K" Size Nitrogen supply tank + 200 Bar regulator for Florida workshop

### Pricing Validation
- [ ] Validate $30 consumer refill price against market (nitrogen tire fills, strut servicing rates)
- [ ] Confirm Hazmat surcharge range ($40-$55) with carrier quotes

### Partner Network
- [ ] Identify first 5 seed partners
- [ ] Validate partner interest in Hologram system economics

### Marketing
- [ ] Produce "ROI One-Pager" for Shop Partners
- [ ] Update website with new MSRPs and "Ready-to-Use" messaging

- **Revenue (Est.):** ~$95,000
- **COGS + Shipping:** ~$38,000
- **Net Profit:** ~$57,000
- **Break-Even Point:** 36 Units
