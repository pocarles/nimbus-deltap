# ∆P Website Redesign Project Plan

**Start Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Owner:** Oslo  
**Approval:** Pierre-Olivier  
**Goal:** Nail the B2B2C partner-first website that converts both partners AND direct buyers

---

## Project Brief (From Pierre-Olivier)

### Core Story (Authenticity First)
"We built this for ourselves because we needed it and loved it. Now we're assessing if the market wants it too."

### Dual Audience Reality

**For Clients:**
- You can buy from us (we'll ship, but not ideal)
- That's why we're building a partner network
- If you know potential partners, send them our way

**For Partners:**
- This could be the beginning of something huge
- Easy, profitable side business (recurring revenue)
- Low investment, high value if you're already close to our target audience

### Target Audiences for Partners
- Aviation
- Off-road suspensions
- Racing
- Mountain biking & bicycles
- Dirt bikes
- Industrial nitrogen applications

### Key Messaging Points
1. We're still Nimbus Suspensions (credibility)
2. We started this project for ourselves
3. Still assessing if the market wants this
4. 20 potential official partners already showed interest
5. 48 states to cover — room for many more
6. Timeline: Q2/Q3 2026 (pending demand validation)

## Success Criteria

### For Partners (Critical)
Make it GENUINELY CONVINCING that this is:
1. **Low investment** — minimal upfront cost
2. **Recurring revenue** — customers come back
3. **Easy side business** — if already serving target audiences
4. **First-mover advantage** — not exclusive, but early partners win
5. **Part of something bigger** — Nimbus credibility + growing network

### For Direct Buyers
1. Clear path to purchase
2. Understand why partners exist (shipping constraints)
3. Trust the pre-launch model (refundable, no commitment)
4. Feel confident in Nimbus quality

---

## Design Constraints

### Keep (Don't Break)
- ✅ Current design quality (not vanilla)
- ✅ Video (really cool)
- ✅ Photos, colors, fonts (Nimbus branding)
- ✅ Premium feel

### Change (Improve)
- ❌ Single-audience focus (currently too B2C)
- ❌ Unclear pre-launch logic ($100 confusion)
- ❌ Partner value prop buried
- ❌ No clear "why partners exist" story

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Research (Week of Feb 9)
**Sub-agents deployed:**
1. Partner program best practices
2. Dual-audience conversion optimization
3. Competitor & adjacent market analysis

**Deliverables:**
- `/root/nimbus/deltap/research-partner-programs.md`
- `/root/nimbus/deltap/research-conversion-best-practices.md`
- `/root/nimbus/deltap/research-competitor-analysis.md`

**Timeline:** 3 sub-agents running now (10min each)

---

### Phase 2: Strategic Wireframes (Week of Feb 16)
Based on research findings, design:

**Homepage structure:**
1. Hero (authentic origin story + dual audience CTAs)
2. Why we built this (authenticity)
3. Dual reality section (clients vs partners)
4. Partner value proposition (CONVINCING)
5. Product/tech (existing content, keep)
6. Reserve section (pre-launch clarity)
7. FAQ (address both audiences)

**Partners page structure:**
1. Hero (this could be huge)
2. Why this works (low investment, recurring, easy)
3. Target audience fit (aviation, off-road, etc.)
4. Social proof (20 partners, 48 states to go)
5. How it works (no exclusivity, but first-mover advantage)
6. Reserve partner spot ($100 logic)

**Copy framework:**
- Authentic story throughout
- Clear market reality (shipping constraints → partners)
- Compelling partner economics (recurring revenue + numbers)
- Risk reversal (refundable, no commitment)
- Social proof (20 partners, Nimbus credibility)

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (Iterative)
**Work in:** `/root/deltap-website-dev/`  
**Review with:** Pierre-Olivier at each milestone  
**Deploy to production:** Only when fully approved

**Iteration cycle:**
1. Build section
2. Review via screenshot/staging
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Repeat until perfect

---

## Research Questions (For Sub-Agents)

### Partner Programs
- What makes a partner program landing page convert?
- How do successful B2B2C models position partner value?
- What objections do potential partners have? (How to overcome?)
- Best examples of "recurring revenue side business" messaging?

### Dual Audience Conversion
- How to serve two audiences without confusing either?
- Navigation strategies (equal weight vs segmented)?
- Hero section tactics (dual CTAs that work)?
- Social proof for pre-launch products?

### Competitive Landscape
- Who else does portable nitrogen?
- How do adjacent industries (mobile detailing, tool rental) structure partner networks?
- What gaps exist in the market?
- How do we differentiate (beyond product quality)?

## Key Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Partners don't see the opportunity as compelling  
**Mitigation:** Research-backed value prop, real economics, social proof

**Risk 2:** Direct buyers get confused by partner focus  
**Mitigation:** Clear segmentation, equal visibility for both paths

**Risk 3:** Pre-launch model feels sketchy  
**Mitigation:** Transparency, refundable messaging, Nimbus credibility

**Risk 4:** Design quality drops during iteration  
**Mitigation:** Keep existing assets (video, photos, branding), don't reinvent

---

## Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

1. **Partner signups** (goal: 100+ partners by Q2 2026)
2. **Direct reservations** (goal: validate demand for production decision)
3. **Conversion rate** (partners vs direct, A/B test messaging)
4. **Bounce rate** (ensure both audiences find what they need)
5. **Time on page** (engagement with value prop content)

---

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. ✅ Sub-agents running research (due in ~10min)
2. ⏳ Review research findings when complete
3. ⏳ Synthesize insights into strategic recommendations
4. ⏳ Present wireframe/copy concepts to Pierre-Olivier
5. ⏳ Iterate based on feedback
6. ⏳ Implement approved changes in dev environment
7. ⏳ Review, refine, deploy when ready

## Notes from Pierre-Olivier

**On authenticity:**
> "We keep on telling the story why we went to this project, doing it for ourselves because we needed it and loved it and all that."

**On partner opportunity:**
> "That project could be the very beginning of something huge and you want to be part of it because we know the Nimbus are, and it's an incredibly easy and profitable side business."

**On quality:**
> "That's an important project. It has to be successful, and I want you to use the very best practices."

**On approach:**
> "We have plenty of time to do this thing, but let's nail it. You can spawn as many sub-agents as you want to do some researches, but let's nail this project."

**Status:** Research phase in progress  
**Next update:** When sub-agents complete (ETA 10min)
