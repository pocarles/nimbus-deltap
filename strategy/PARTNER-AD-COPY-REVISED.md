"Quick question before you apply to the ∆P Partner Program:

Do you actually know aviation? Off-road? Racing?

[Pause]

Not just 'interested in' — I mean, do your customers trust you with their suspension? Their aircraft?

[Shows ∆P equipment]

Because that's who we're looking for.

Shop owners. Mobile mechanics. Trackside teams.

People who already serve these communities and want to add nitrogen refill service.

[Shows profit breakdown on screen]

$30 service. $5.50 cost. 10 minutes.

If you know the niche, the economics speak for themselves.

[Shows phone with application]

Apply at the link. We'll ask about your background.

Not looking for random side hustlers. Looking for people who know what they're doing."
