# Partner Strategy Correction (2026-02-09)

**From Pierre-Olivier:**

## ❌ WRONG: "No Experience Required"

The research recommended lowering barriers with "no experience required" messaging. This is INCORRECT for ∆P.

## ✅ CORRECT: Industry Expertise Required

**Partners MUST have:**
- Existing business in target verticals (aviation, off-road, racing, MTB, dirt bikes)
- Industry credibility and customer relationships
- Technical understanding (even if not nitrogen-specific)

**Why this matters:**
1. **Brand representation** — Partners use Nimbus name, quality matters
2. **Customer trust** — Aviation mechanics, suspension pros = credible refill providers
3. **Natural fit** — They're already serving our target customers

## Example: Cigar Lounge Guy

Someone from a cigar lounge expressed interest → NOT the right fit.

No industry connection to aviation/off-road/racing → no credibility with target audience.

## Revised Messaging Framework

**Instead of:** "No experience required — we'll train you!"

**Use:** "Already serving pilots, racers, or off-roaders? Add nitrogen refill to your offerings."

**Target partners:**
- Aviation mechanics / FBOs
- Off-road suspension shops
- Racing shops / trackside services
- Mountain bike shops (suspension specialists)
- Dirt bike dealers / service centers
- Industrial equipment providers (who understand high-pressure systems)

**Value prop:**
"Your customers already trust you for [aviation/suspension/racing]. Now you can offer them nitrogen service too — recurring revenue from people who know you."

## Strategic Implication

This is a **quality-first partner network**, not a mass-market franchise.

- Recruit selectively (10 great partners > 100 mediocre ones)
- Focus on industry credibility
- Leverage existing customer relationships
- Nimbus brand quality extends to partners

## Updated Copy Direction

**Hero for partners page:**
"Join the ∆P Partner Network — For Aviation, Off-Road & Racing Professionals"

**Subhead:**
"Already serving pilots, racers, or off-road enthusiasts? Add nitrogen refill service to your business. Recurring revenue. Minimal investment. Your customers already trust you."

**Qualification section (add to partners page):**
"**Is This Right for You?**

This program is designed for professionals already serving our target markets:
- Aviation mechanics & FBOs
- Off-road suspension specialists
- Racing shops & trackside service teams
- Mountain bike shops (suspension-focused)
- Dirt bike dealers & service centers
- Industrial equipment providers

If you're already close to these communities, you're in the right place. If not, this may not be the right fit."

**Key takeaway:** We're not lowering the barrier to entry. We're recruiting the RIGHT partners — professionals who already have industry credibility and customer relationships in our target verticals.
