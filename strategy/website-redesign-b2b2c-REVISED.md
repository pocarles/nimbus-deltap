# ∆P Website Redesign: B2B2C Strategy (REVISED)

**Date:** 2026-02-09  
**Author:** Oslo  
**Status:** Updated based on Pierre-Olivier's feedback

---

## Core Strategy (Updated)

**Target Audience:** BOTH partners AND direct buyers
- Partners (shops + solo entrepreneurs)
- Direct buyers (Nimbus clients + end users)
- Story: Assessing market interest — we need both to validate demand

**Key Message:**  
"Buy from us OR buy from our partners. We're gauging demand to decide if we should manufacture this."

---

## Homepage Changes

### 1. Hero Section (Dual Audience)

**Headline:**  
> "The First Portable Nitrogen System Built for Partners & Enthusiasts"

**Subhead:**  
> "Whether you want to build a refill business or equip your own shop, we're gauging demand to see if we should manufacture the ∆P. Reserve your spot — 100% refundable if we don't launch."

**Two Equal CTAs (side by side):**
- "Become a Partner" (partners.html)
- "Reserve for Your Shop" (#reserve)

**Visual:** Keep product-focused (not partner-only). Show versatility.

---

### 2. Clarify Pre-Launch Logic (Reserve Section)

**Current problem:** People think $100 = commitment to buy

**New messaging:**

> **"Help Us Validate Demand — Reserve Your Spot"**
>
> We're assessing market interest to decide if we should manufacture the ∆P.
>
> **Your $100 reservation:**
> - Secures your 28% early-bird discount (if we launch)
> - Gets you priority access (Q2 or Q3 2026)
> - 100% refundable if we don't go into production
> - No commitment — you decide later if you want to complete the purchase
>
> **For Partners:** This also timestamps your participation in the partner program.
>
> **For Direct Buyers:** This holds your discounted price.
>
> We need both partners AND customers to validate demand. Your reservation helps us decide.

---

### 3. Partner Program Clarity

**Key corrections:**
- ✅ No territory exclusivity
- ✅ Partners can resell ∆P + provide refill service
- ✅ Official partner listing on future locator site
- ✅ First movers get natural advantage (but no guaranteed exclusivity)

**Updated partners.html messaging:**

> **"Join the Official ∆P Partner Network"**
>
> **What Partners Can Do:**
> - Resell ∆P systems to your customers
> - Provide nitrogen refill services
> - Get listed on our official partner locator (future website)
>
> **No Territory Exclusivity** — but first partners in each area will have a natural advantage. The earlier you join, the better positioned you'll be when we launch.
>
> **Already 20 partners signed up** in the first 10 days. Reserve your spot now.

---

## Navigation Changes

**Current nav:**  
Story | Technology | Specs | FAQ | Partners | Contact

**Proposed nav:**  
**Partners** | For Your Shop | Story | Tech | Specs | FAQ | Contact

- Partners first (signals importance)
- "For Your Shop" instead of generic "Reserve Now" (clarifies direct purchase path)

**Alternative (if you prefer equal weight):**  
Story | Technology | Specs | Partners | For Your Shop | FAQ | Contact

## Copy Changes: Before & After

### Homepage Hero

**BEFORE:**  
> "Portable Nitrogen System for Suspension Tuning"  
> "We built this for ourselves. Now we're gauging demand to see if we should produce it for others."  
> [Single CTA: "Reserve Your Spot"]

**AFTER:**  
> "The First Portable Nitrogen System Built for Partners & Enthusiasts"  
> "Join as a partner or reserve for your own shop. We're assessing demand — your $100 reservation (100% refundable) helps us decide if we should manufacture this."  
> [Dual CTA: "Become a Partner" | "Reserve for Your Shop"]

---

### Reserve Section

**BEFORE:**  
> "28% off for the first 100"  
> "Lock in your discounted price with a $100 refundable deposit. Limited spots available."

**AFTER:**  
> "Reserve Your Pre-Launch Spot — $100 Refundable"  
> "We're gauging demand. Your reservation helps us decide if we should manufacture the ∆P. For partners, this timestamps your participation. For direct buyers, this holds your discount. 100% refundable if we don't launch."

---

### Partners Page

**Add this section at the top (after hero):**

> **"How the Partner Program Works"**
>
> **Your $100 Signup:**
> - Timestamps your participation in the partner program
> - Secures priority access if we go into production
> - 100% refundable if we don't launch
>
> **What You Can Do:**
> - Resell ∆P systems to customers in your area
> - Provide nitrogen refill services
> - Get listed on our official partner locator
>
> **No Territory Exclusivity** — but early partners will have a natural advantage when we launch. First movers in each area are better positioned to build customer relationships and brand recognition.
>
> **20 partners already signed up** in 10 days. Join them.

---

## Social Proof to Add

**Homepage stats section (add):**
- "20 Official Partners Registered" (or just "20 Partners Joined")

**Partners page:**
- "Join 20 partners who've already reserved their spot"

---

## Timeline Messaging

**Everywhere "Q2 2026" appears, change to:**  
> "Q2 or Q3 2026 (pending demand validation)"

Or shorter:  
> "Q2–Q3 2026"

---

## Key Principles (Your Feedback)

1. ✅ **Both audiences matter** — partners AND direct buyers
2. ✅ **Both paths visible** — "Buy from us OR from our partners"
3. ✅ **No territory exclusivity** — official listing + natural first-mover advantage only
4. ✅ **Pre-launch clarity** — $100 = gauging demand, not commitment
5. ✅ **Collaboration required** — iterate together on terms/messaging

---

## Proposed First Changes (for your approval)

I recommend starting with these three changes to the dev site:

**Change 1: Homepage Hero CTA**
- Add second CTA: "Become a Partner"
- Update headline to mention both audiences
- Clarify "we're gauging demand"

**Change 2: Reserve Section Messaging**
- Add pre-launch clarity (refundable, no commitment)
- Explain what $100 means for partners vs direct buyers
- Change timeline to Q2–Q3 2026

**Change 3: Partners Page Top Section**
- Add "How the Partner Program Works"
- Clarify no territory exclusivity
- Add "20 partners joined" social proof

---

## Questions Before I Start

1. **Homepage hero CTA:** Both equal weight, or do you want one primary?
2. **Navigation:** Put Partners first, or keep equal weight?
3. **Social proof phrasing:** "20 partners signed up" or "20 official partners registered"?
4. **Timeline everywhere:** Just "Q2–Q3 2026" or add "(pending demand validation)"?

Let me know and I'll implement the first round of changes in `/root/deltap-website-dev/` for your review.
