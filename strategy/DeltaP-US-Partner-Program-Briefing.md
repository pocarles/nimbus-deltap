# ∆P (DeltaP) US Partner Program — Financial Projections Briefing

**Prepared by:** Oslo (AI Assistant to Pierre-Olivier Carles, CEO Nimbus Suspensions)
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Purpose:** Provide all necessary data to build comprehensive financial projections for the ∆P Partner Program US launch.

---

## 1. WHAT IS ∆P?

∆P is a portable nitrogen cartridge system manufactured by Nimbus Suspensions. It allows users to charge, adjust, and maintain nitrogen-charged suspension systems (oleo-pneumatic) on-site — no shop visit needed. The cartridge stores nitrogen at 120 bar (~1,740 PSI) and delivers regulated output pressure for suspension tuning.

**Key product components:**
- **Head V2** — Pressure regulation head that manages nitrogen flow from cartridge
- **Cartridge** — 0.450L aluminum cylinder, pre-filled with nitrogen, refillable
- **Nitrogen Charging Ramp (160 bar)** — Equipment for refilling cartridges
- **Digital Gauge** — Precision pressure measurement for suspension tuning

**Current market:** ∆P is manufactured in France by PFF (Production Functional Factory) and sold to end consumers via the website deltap.nimbus-suspensions.com. Nimbus is now launching a US Partner Program to scale distribution through local service partners.

- **Pre-launch price:** $999
- **Regular price (post-launch):** $1,499
- Kit includes: Nitrogen Charging Ramp, Digital Gauge, Head V2, Cartridge, hologram seals, listing on Partner Locator
- **Nimbus COGS (landed in Florida):** $807.35

### Stream 2: Hardware Sales — Heads & Cartridges (ongoing)
- Partners buy ∆P kits (Head V2 + Cartridge) from Nimbus at wholesale to resell and install for end customers
- **End customer retail price:** $849 (standard kit) / $1,099 (pro kit)
- **Nimbus COGS (landed, Head + Cartridge + shipping):** $305.04
- Partners earn a progressive commission (see Section 5)
- Nimbus sells to partners at: Retail Price × (1 - Commission%)

### Stream 3: Refill Fees (recurring)
- Every time a partner refills a cartridge for a customer, Nimbus collects a flat fee
- **Nimbus fee per refill:** $3.00 (non-negotiable, clearly disclosed to partners upfront)
- **Suggested customer refill price:** $30
- **Nitrogen cost to partner:** ~$0.50 per refill
- **Partner profit per refill:** ~$26.50 (88% gross margin for the partner)
- **Refill time:** ~5 minutes per cartridge
- **Capture rate assumption:** 80% (we estimate 20-25% of refills may go unreported by partners)

### US Tariffs (Current Regime, Feb 2026)

**Two tariff regimes apply to EU imports:**

1. **EU Reciprocal Tariff: 15%** — US-EU trade deal (July 2025). Applies to most manufactured goods.
2. **Section 232 Steel/Aluminum: 50%** — BUT only on the raw metal content of the product, NOT the full manufactured value. Products subject to 232 are excluded from the reciprocal tariff.

**Applied to ∆P components:**

| Component | Primary Material | Tariff Treatment | Effective Rate |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Head V2 | Aluminum | Section 232 on metal + 15% on mfg value | ~20% blended |
| Cartridge | Aluminum | Section 232 on metal + 15% on mfg value | ~20% blended |
| Ramp | Mixed/equipment | 15% reciprocal | 15% |
| Gauge | Electronic instrument | 15% reciprocal | 15% |

### Landed Costs in Florida (USD)

- Starter kit (all 4 components): ~$50 per unit

**Final landed costs:**
- **Consumer kit (Head + Cartridge + shipping): $305.04**
- **Starter kit (all components + shipping): $807.35**

### Resulting Margins for Nimbus

| Product | Retail Price | Landed COGS | Gross Margin |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Starter Kit | $1,499 | $807.35 | 46.1% |
| Consumer Kit (before commission) | $849 | $305.04 | 64.1% |

## 4. RETAIL PRICING (Consumer-Facing, from deltap.nimbus-suspensions.com)

| Product | Pre-Launch Price | Regular Price |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Standard Kit (Head V2 + 1 Cartridge) | $611 | $849 |
| Pro Kit (Head V2 + Cartridge, larger) | $791 | $1,099 |
| Partner Starter Kit | $999 | $1,499 |

Pre-launch pricing includes a 28% discount for the first 100 customers. Use **regular (post-launch) prices for projections** since we're modeling from June 2026 onward.

---

## 5. PARTNER COMMISSION STRUCTURE

Partners earn a commission on hardware sales (Head + Cartridge kits sold to end customers). The commission is based on **units sold per quarter**, with a **quarterly reset**.

| Tier | Units Sold / Quarter | Commission (% of Retail) | Partner Keeps | Nimbus Wholesale Price |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Tier 1 | 1–10 | 25% | $212.25 | $636.75 |
| Tier 2 | 11–30 | 35% | $297.15 | $551.85 |
| Tier 3 | 31+ | 40% | $339.60 | $509.40 |

**Key rules:**
- Tiers reset every quarter — no permanent tier status
- A partner who sells fewer units next quarter drops back to Tier 1
- Maximum commission is 40% — it does not go higher
- Commission is calculated on the $849 standard retail price

**Nimbus gross profit per unit sold (at $849 retail, COGS $305.04):**

| Tier | Wholesale to Partner | Nimbus Gross | Nimbus Margin |
|------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 (25%) | $636.75 | $331.71 | 52.1% |
| Tier 2 (35%) | $551.85 | $246.81 | 44.7% |
| Tier 3 (40%) | $509.40 | $204.36 | 40.1% |

## 6. HYPOTHESES FOR PROJECTIONS

### Launch Timeline
- **Launch date:** June 2026
- **Projection period:** 18 months (June 2026 – November 2027)

### Partner Onboarding
- **Rate:** 10–15 new partners per month (use **12/month as midpoint**)
- **Requires:** A dedicated person managing partner recruitment and onboarding
- **Churn:** Near-zero expected. Partners have already purchased their starter kit. No ongoing fees. They simply keep operating and refilling when business comes. No reason to "drop off."

### Partner Sales Ramp (Hardware Units Sold Per Month)

Partners don't hit full speed immediately. Suggested ramp:

| Months Active | Units Sold / Month | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1–2 | 2 | Getting started, learning the product |
| 3–5 | 3 | Finding customers, building word of mouth |
| 6–9 | 4 | Established, steady flow |
| 10+ | 5 | Mature, repeat customers + referrals |

**This is conservative.** A strong partner in a dense market could do 10+/month. Adjust scenarios accordingly.

### Partner Refill Ramp (Refills Per Month)

Each refill = one cartridge serviced. Refill volume grows as partners accumulate customers:

| Months Active | Refills / Month | Rationale |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1–2 | 10 | Few installed cartridges in the field |
| 3–5 | 20 | Customer base growing |
| 6–9 | 35 | Solid installed base |
| 10+ | 50 | Mature book of repeat customers |

### Refill Capture Rate
- **80% of actual refills are reported and paid to Nimbus**
- We assume 20–25% leakage from partners who under-report or skip the system
- This is a known risk built into the model

## 7. TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET (TAM)

These are categories of US businesses that could become ∆P partners:

| Segment | Estimated Count (US) | Source |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Aircraft mechanics & technicians | 160,800 | BLS (2024) |
| FAA certified repair stations | ~3,700 | FAA (~75% of 4,900 global) |
| Fixed Base Operators (FBOs) | 850+ | GlobalAir directory |
| Auto repair & maintenance shops | 176,000+ | BLS / Statista (2023-2025) |
| Auto body shops | 72,000–118,000 | Multiple sources |
| Motorcycle / powersports dealers | 15,781 | IBISWorld (2025) |
| Golf cart dealers | 919–5,924 | IBISWorld / directory data |
| RV repair shops | 9,205 | Directory data (2025) |
| Specialty bicycle / e-bike shops | 3,000–7,000 | NBDA / Zippia |
| Off-road / 4x4 specialty shops | 5,000–8,000 | Estimated subset of auto repair |

**Realistic addressable market: 30,000–50,000 businesses**

At 12 partners/month:
- Year 1: 144 partners = **<0.5% of TAM**
- 18 months: 216 partners = **<0.7% of TAM**

The market is not the constraint. Execution speed is.

## 8. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

### US Manufacturing Option (Under Exploration)
- Nimbus is exploring manufacturing the Head and Ramp locally in Florida
- Materials: Aluminum and steel, 120 bar operating pressure
- Volume: ~500 units/year initially
- **Benefit:** Eliminates tariffs on those components entirely, reduces shipping costs and lead times
- **Status:** Early research phase — CNC manufacturer shortlist compiled but no quotes yet

### Competitive Position
- No other portable nitrogen cartridge exists at this pressure (120 bar), size, and weight
- The ∆P is unique — partners are selling a product with no direct substitute
- Competition claims must be qualified: "no other portable cartridge at this pressure, at this size and weight"

### Partner Types Already Showing Interest
- Jason Kehl: ex-truck driver, Amazon seller, golf cart buyer/seller (inquiry received Feb 9, 2026)
- Target partner profile: industry experts in aviation, off-road, racing, mobile service — not "random side hustlers"

### What's NOT Included in This Model
- **Marketing/advertising costs** (currently $39/day on Meta ads = ~$1,170/month)
- **Salary for partner recruitment person**
- **Operational costs** (Florida facility, cartridge filling, admin)
- **Pre-launch deposit revenue** ($100/partner, currently collecting via Stripe)
- **Pro kit sales** ($1,099 retail) — model uses standard $849 only for simplicity
- **Additional cartridge sales** (partners may need extra cartridges beyond what's in the kit)
- **Price increases over time**

## 9. WHAT WE NEED CALCULATED

Build an **18-month financial projection (June 2026 – November 2027)** that includes:

1. **Monthly revenue breakdown** by all 3 streams (starter kits, hardware, refills)
2. **Monthly gross profit** using the landed COGS provided
3. **Quarterly summaries** showing compounding effect
4. **Year 1 totals** and **18-month totals**
5. **Month 18 annualized run rate** (what the business looks like on a recurring basis)
6. **Sensitivity analysis** with 3 scenarios:
   - **Conservative:** 10 partners/month, 2 units/partner/month avg, 20 refills/partner/month avg
   - **Base:** 12 partners/month, 3 units avg, 30 refills avg
   - **Optimistic:** 15 partners/month, 5 units avg, 50 refills avg
7. **Break-even analysis** — at what point do refill fees alone cover operational costs?
8. **Commission tier impact** — what % of revenue goes to partner commissions at each scenario?
9. **US manufacturing impact** — how do margins change if Head + Cartridge are made in Florida (eliminating tariffs and reducing shipping)?
