## Creative Production Checklist

### Needed Assets

- [ ] UGC video — recruit shop owner for testimonial (or staged)
- [ ] Map graphic — showing territories concept
- [ ] Solo entrepreneur video — trailhead setting
- [ ] Explainer motion graphic — hire animator or use Canva/After Effects

### Specifications
- **Images:** 1080x1080 (square), 1080x1350 (4:5), 1080x1920 (story)
- **Videos:** 9:16 aspect ratio, 15-60 seconds, captions required
- **File sizes:** Images < 30MB, Videos < 4GB

- Refresh winning concepts every 30-60 days before fatigue
- Monitor CPMr — if rising, creative is exhausted

## Competitive Considerations

**Note:** No direct competitors currently run Meta ads for similar B2B partner programs in this niche. This is a whitespace opportunity.

**Power Tank (Shock Boss):** Consumer-focused, no visible partner program advertising.

**Opportunity:** First-mover advantage in recruiting the off-road shop network via paid social.

---

## Appendix: Platform Updates (January 2026)

### Meta Andromeda Algorithm (Key Implications)
- **Creative diversity rewarded:** Algorithm can process 10,000x more ad variants
- **Simplify structure:** 1-3 campaigns max, let CBO optimize
- **Feed variety:** Different concepts > iterations of same concept
- **Vertical-first:** 90% of inventory is vertical format

### Lead Ads Best Practices
- Higher Intent forms improve lead quality (more friction = more qualified)
- Pre-filled fields reduce drop-off
- Custom questions filter tire-kickers
- Thank you screen should set expectations (48hr response)

### B2B on Meta
- Less common than Google, but effective for niche B2B
- Target business interests + passion indicators (off-road = both)
- Longer consideration cycle — expect 2-4 touchpoints before conversion
- Follow up fast (within 24hr for best conversion)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Design/produce creative assets** (priority: carousel + 1 video)
2. **Set up Meta Business Manager** with pixel on deltap site
3. **Create lead form** per specifications above
4. **Launch Phase 1 test** with $50/day
5. **Review results weekly** — optimize or kill underperformers
6. **Scale winners** after 2-4 weeks of data
